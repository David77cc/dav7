					Well this isn't a fully developed website, this is a side

					using a valid email is pointless since you won't be
					receiving an email from this website. Ultimately, the choice

					address.Your information won't be shared with anyone but as
					a side project it's best to keep it simple #KIS ðŸ‘Œ.
