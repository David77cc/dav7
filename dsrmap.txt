Roadmap to Master Data Structures
Foundations: Big-O Notation

Learn how to measure time and space complexity.
Understand the trade-offs between different data structures.
Basic Data Structures

Arrays and Strings: Sequential data handling.
Linked Lists: Dynamic memory usage.
Stacks and Queues: LIFO and FIFO principles.
Advanced Data Structures

Hash Tables/Hash Maps: Fast lookups and retrievals.
Trees: Binary trees, binary search trees, AVL, heaps.
Graphs: Representation (adjacency list/matrix) and traversal (DFS, BFS).
Sorting and Searching Algorithms

Bubble, Merge, Quick sort.
Binary search and variations.
Specialized Data Structures

Tries: Efficient prefix-based searches.
Segment Trees: Range queries.
Disjoint Sets (Union-Find): For graph algorithms.
Applications

Learn practical uses of data structures in solving problems.
Dive into LeetCode, HackerRank, or Codeforces for hands-on practice.
Combine with Algorithms

Learn common algorithms (Dynamic Programming, Greedy, Divide & Conquer) and pair them with suitable data structures.
